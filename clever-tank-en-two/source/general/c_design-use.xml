		<p>Safety devices installed in the system by the manufacturer are only for the basic prevention of accidents. The main responsibility for an accident-free workflow mainly lies with the
			business owner who operates the system as well as with the individuals they nominate to operate the system, perform maintenance or carry out any other work on the system.</p>
		<p>The appropriate operation according to the intended purpose and compliance with the care, service and maintenance measures, that are prescribed by the manufacturer, ensure the
			functionality as well as a high lifespan of the membrane modules and of the system components, thus helping to prevent work-related accidents and occupational injuries.</p>
		<p>The staff intended to operate and maintain the system described in this document must read and understand the specific chapter written in the operation manual and must apply the
			instructions with due diligence. In the interest of operational safety and accident prevention, only staff who are well-trained may be assigned the task of handling the system. The
			staff must receive special instructions regarding any potential risk.</p>
		<p>The manufacturer is not liable for any damage to persons or equipment, resulting from improper handling or non-compliance with the instructions indicated above. The Owner and/or the
			Operator of the system shall assume the full liability.</p>
		<p>Operating the system in a different manner than that described in the operation manual will result in the loss of any warranty or warranty claims against the manufacturer.</p>
