				<span class="q">“Prior to the installation of an own recovery system, the customer must inform the water utility company. The customer must take the appropriate steps to ensure that the own

			<div class="note restriction"><span class="restrictiontitle">Restriction:</span> Installation must be carried out by trained qualified staff.</div>

			<div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">When carrying out the installation the current technical rules for domestic installations must be observed (<em class="ph i">DIN1988</em>, <em class="ph i">EN1717</em>).</div>

			<div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">The system must be fitted with its own fuse protection (FI).</div>

			<div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">The installation room must be provided with floor drainage.</div>

			<div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution">The grey water manifolds must be vented in such a way that the air blown into the wastewater system can escape freely via the vent of the grey water
				manifold.</div>

			<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> When operated correctly, the treated grey water will attain the quality stipulated in the <em class="ph i">Bathing Water Directive of the EU</em>.</div>

			<div class="note restriction"><span class="restrictiontitle">Restriction:</span> Emptying of the grey water vessel must only be carried out by trained service staff. If the filter dries out, this will destroy the membrane.</div>

			<div class="cautiontitle">CAUTION:</div><div class="note caution"><p class="p"><em class="ph i">EN 12056-1</em> defines grey water as faecal-free, slightly contaminated wastewater, such as that accumulated from taking showers, or baths or from washing
					hands, and also that which comes out of the washing machine and can be used as service and process water when treated. A grey water treatment system is used exclusively
					for the treatment and recycling of slightly contaminated, faecal-free wastewater.</p>

				<p class="p">Due to the fat content, a kitchen drain should not be connected.</p>

				<p class="p">In the case of highly contaminated wastewater from toilets, kitchen drains or washing machines, quality objectives of treatment will not be achieved and damage to the
					membrane cannot be ruled out.</p>

				<p class="p">The supply of strong alkaline cleaning products (chlorine cleaner etc.), dispersion paints, lacquers, hair dyes, oils and fats affects the performance of the membrane and
					the quality of the service water and must be avoided. Large amounts of fats and oils in particular can cause irreversible damage to the membrane.</p>
